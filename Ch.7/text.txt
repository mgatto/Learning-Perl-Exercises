Fred flinstone wants to go to visit
his friend barney. But wilma really
wants fred to visit her old grandpa
Alfred, who lives in another city
which is not close by at all, and
infested with tyrannosauri.

Fred has not said whether he will
go or not. The stern Mrs. Wilam Flinstone
says that he shall. 

Some will say they are really wilma&fred.

Mr. Slate seems to have different
plans for him? In 2 minutes, we
will know for darn sure.

a good bet is that he's not coming.
